I'm planning to write about my experience with a Burton bag.

## Initial impressions in store

I came across the Burton outlet store in Yokohama, Japan. The bags
right in front of the door looked perfect, though I would love love
love to have a bag with wheels *and* shoulder straps.

The sign says Lifetime Warranty, which isn't Briggs-Riley-level, but
the bag seems tough enough that I'll be happy with paying $250 for
it.  (I expect it will last minimum of 5 years, so $50 per year or $2
per month ain't bad.)

The sales guy let me put my shoes (in a plastic bag) in the bag; they
fit easily.  My files fit easily.  My computer fit easily.  I didn't
dump out *all* the junk in my bag, but that will be the next step when
I go visit the flagship store in Shibuya.

The handle on top looks super tough.  The bag is available in 4 or 5
color/designs.

My only concern is the wheels (IXION (sp)) look a bit soft, better
suited for smooth tile than the rough asphalt near my house.

## Pre Sales Email Support

So, before buying the bag, I emailed the following the info@burton.com

    Hello

    I'm interested in your Wheelie Flyer, which I found at a Burton
    outlet here in Japan.  It seems quite strong and holds all the
    things I regularly want to carry.

    I am a bit concerned about the wheels.  I walk about 4km daily on
    rough asphalt.  How will the Wheelie Flyer's IXION wheels feel
    about that? They seem easy enough to change, but I just wonder how
    long they'll last.  I know it's nearly impossible to give a
    number, but can you give me an idea of what they're designed to
    handle?  I don't usually walk through gritty sand, but sometimes
    through puddles of water, and sometimes across gravel.. and lots
    of times across rough+sharp asphalt.

    My other question involves water-proofedness.  I know the bags
    aren't rated to be waterproof, but do you have / recommend a
    waterproof cover that fits nicely on the Wheelie Flyer?

    Thanks very much for your time
       - Rob


    ps: I found this page when looking up the wheels

It took a couple days, but I received this 22:44pm 24 June 2016

    Hey Rob,
    
    Thanks for reaching out to us the Ixion wheels that we use are
    skateboard wheels with sealed bearing which will give you great
    durability over rough and varied terrain. Plus our bags including
    the wheels are backed by a lifetime warranty against breaking. As
    for the water proofing of the bag, they are made with a water
    resistant nylon that will keep your belongings safe through most
    conditions. Unfortunately, we do not have any rain covers
    available directly. Also, there are no covers designed to work
    exclusively with this bag. Most are designed to work with back
    packs though you could use them on the flyer as long as the cover
    is sized to the dimensions of the pack. the Wheelie flyer is 25L
    and has dimensions of 18in x 12in x 9.5in. Please let us know if
    you have any further questions or concerns.
    
    Sincerely,
    
    Tim H | Rider Service | BURTON

Tim didn't mention the broken link, but it's been fixed!

Thanks, Tim!

Okay, so I'm pretty set on buying the bag.  I want to make sure it has
a couple small pockets to hold toothbrush+toothpaste+floss, pens,
phone chargers, and computer chargers.

Oh, and bonus: I was able to use a 100 character password on
info.burton.com so that pretty much tells me they don't save them in
plaintext.

Ah, `dig` tells me it's a CNAME for zendesk.com.  Fair enough.

Oh my goodness so sad!  I went to Burton today, completely set and
happy to buy the bag, but it's simply too small!!!  I brought all the
junk I often carry in my backpack: extra shoes, etc... but they simply
wouldn't fit nicely.  The bag looks hella strong enough but not big
enough.  So the clerk was like, "how about this?" and everything fit,
BUT when I lifted it, the handle was like, "umm are you sure you need
to carry all this?"

Sigh.

There was another bag (wheelie flyer deck) which was big enough and
strong enough, but didn't have a place for my backpack.

Aight.  I'll have a look at something else.  Lin is suggesting TUMI.

Forget TUMI; too expensive to not have a lifetime warranty.

## Tuesday 28 June 2016

Today I went to a sewing shop to get some thick thread and needles to
fix my bag.  I'm bummed that my attempt to buy a Burton bag resulted
in Goldilock's Syndrome, but I'm not going to buy a new bag that's not
optimal for my needs.
