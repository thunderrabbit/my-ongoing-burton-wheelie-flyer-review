I figure I can gain fake internet points by writing (and updating) a
mega-detailed(?) review of the Burton bag which caught my eye today.

## Initial impressions in store

I came across the Burton outlet store in Yokohama, Japan. The bags
right in front of the door looked perfect, though I would love love
love to have a bag with wheels *and* shoulder straps.

The sign says Lifetime Warranty, which isn't Briggs-Riley-level, but
the bag seems tough enough that I'll be happy with paying $250 for
it.  (I expect it will last minimum of 5 years, so $50 per year or $2
per month ain't bad.)

The sales guy let me put my shoes (in a plastic bag) in the bag; they
fit easily.  My files fit easily.  My computer fit easily.  I didn't
dump out *all* the junk in my bag, but that will be the next step when
I go visit the flagship store in Shibuya.

The handle on top looks super tough.  The bag is available in 4 or 5
color/designs.

My only concern is the wheels (IXION (sp)) look a bit soft, better
suited for smooth tile than the rough asphalt near my house.

## Pre Sales Email Support

So, before buying the bag, I emailed the following the info@burton.com

    Hello

    I'm interested in your Wheelie Flyer, which I found at a Burton
    outlet here in Japan.  It seems quite strong and holds all the
    things I regularly want to carry.

    I am a bit concerned about the wheels.  I walk about 4km daily on
    rough asphalt.  How will the Wheelie Flyer's IXION wheels feel
    about that? They seem easy enough to change, but I just wonder how
    long they'll last.  I know it's nearly impossible to give a
    number, but can you give me an idea of what they're designed to
    handle?  I don't usually walk through gritty sand, but sometimes
    through puddles of water, and sometimes across gravel.. and lots
    of times across rough+sharp asphalt.

    My other question involves water-proofedness.  I know the bags
    aren't rated to be waterproof, but do you have / recommend a
    waterproof cover that fits nicely on the Wheelie Flyer?

    Thanks very much for your time
       - Rob


    ps: I found this page when looking up the wheels
